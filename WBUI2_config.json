Bosses are to be spawned around the obelisks and fought and killed there, so no bases or tames of other players are in danger. For underwater bosses there will be a boss fight teleporter.\n\n3. Don't grief other players by drowning them, luring dinos to their bases, etc. Bannable.\n\n4. Don't kill dinos other players are taming. Accidents can happen of course, but don't make it a habit.\n\n5. Don't block big resource spots, cave entrances or artifacts or you might get asked to move or your structures get removed. Building in artifact caves is allowed if the artifacts in the cave are still accessible for other players.\n\n6. No spamming to claim base spots or spots in general. No spam around the base, this is PvE. If you want protection put up a bubble.\n\n7. You can glitch yourself under the map or build in the mesh if you want but if you have a problem and an admin can't help you there that is your problem then.\n\n8. If you set up a teleporter at a nice resource or artifact location just make it public so everyone can benefit.\n\n9. Always equip the dinos you use with Awesome Trackers so u can recover them from glitched / meshed spots yourself.\n\n10. Don't push character, tribe or tame names too far (for example being racist, sexist, ...). A bit of fun is alright of course.\n\n11. Don't build unnecessary structures and trap all dinos you don't need to be out to lower strain on the server.\n\n12. Kill all dinos you knocked out and don't want to tame and pick up traps after taming."
